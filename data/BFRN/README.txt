ButtressingFluxResponseNumbers.mat contains matrixes x,y which are the x- and y-coordinates of the center points of each square (with an area 20*20km²) in meters (polar-stereographic projection). BRFN are given for each square (0 in non-floating regions and where response is smaller than the threshold 0.02%). 

BFRN = R/P with R the response in flux integrated over all grounding lines and P the perturbation strength for each square. Multiply by 100 to get the unit %. 

Assuming that the flux responds linearly to the perturbations, the change in flux across the grounding line resulting from a perturbation of X [Gt] over an area that lies within the square p is given by X × BFRN(p) [Gt/yr]. The response to a perturbation over larger areas is given as the sum of the perturbation within each square.
